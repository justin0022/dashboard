# Dashboard
A React single page application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses [D3](https://d3js.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), and [Emoji Feedback](https://github.com/ubc/emoji-feedback).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node 8.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

### Installing and Setup

1. First, clone this repo. `git clone https://github.com/justin0022/dashboard.git`
1. Then cd into the repo. `cd dashboard`
1. Run the installation script. `npm install` (If you see `babel-node: command not found`, you've missed this step.)
